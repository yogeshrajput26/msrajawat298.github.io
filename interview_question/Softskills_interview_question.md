# Question: Tell me about yourself.
## Sample answers 1 : 
From a very early age I've been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it worked—and then try to put it back together. As you can imagine, it drove my parents nuts. But even though I tortured my family at times, the tinkering trait has served me well in my career. After graduating from Purdue, I was recruited into a field technician job and got paid to take apart broken packaging equipment. It was like living the dream. That job also made me realize I'm really good with difficult customers, and that's what helped me land my current account manager role. While I love my job and have been successful in it, it has moved me away from the manufacturing floor. Now, the reason I'm so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of one-on-one work with clients and hands-on problem solving. Why this answer worked well:He gave a vivid image of his childhood home and told a memorable story about it.He picked two prominent required skills from the job description, problem solving and customer service, and built this interesting narrative around it.He showed how his career successfully evolved before he was even asked about that.

In my current role as the marketing analyst responsible for a shampoo product line, my core responsibility is to assist the marketing manager to prepare the analytics for monthly sales, as well as a sales prediction model. I also manage the campaign budget, prepare wrap-up reports, and connect with our marketing agencies. All of this requires analytical thinking, attention to detail, and clear communication skills. My current role has provided me solid execution experience in all the marketing aspects, including campaign planning, campaign management and analysis. I am looking for a marketing manager role, where I can make a bigger impact as an individual contributor, as well as delve into strategic planning, and potentially grow into a people manager in a few years.

I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life, personal and professional. In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I’ve taken on many different types of projects, including ads, virtual reality, commerce, and messaging. No matter what I’m working on, I’m very invested. I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process. In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles. I found it fascinating, and it actually sparked a desire to change industries — which eventually led me to my last role and even helped prepare me for the switch. Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors. Why this answer worked well:Background and type of experience were clearly explained.Candidate showcased a self-starter mentality.Hobbies were framed to highlight benefits to professional life.

This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.
 
Be succinct, honest and engaging.

I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.
 
Use the job description to prepare.

Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.
 
Tie your story to their needs.

People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.

Tips
Prepare for this question in advance and have a compelling story about your past experiences.
Pull prominent skills from the job description.
Be “SHE” (succinct, honest and engaging).




Strengths
 Good Planner and Quick Learner.
 Ability to deliver things within time constraint.
 Confident and always ready to take challenges.
 Believe in Team work.
 Always excited for learning something new.


# Question: What is your greatest strength?

## Sample answers 1 :
What I bring to the team is a strong record in relationship building. I'm happiest when I'm engaging and strategizing about how we can help one another. I find that in sales, some people can be overly transactional. I think my superpower is in establishing more meaningful connections. I've gotten strong feedback in the past. One client said I was the best business development person he'd ever met. These types of connections have turned into big sales wins. For example, last year, I doubled my client base and outperformed my peers by 40%. And it's probably relevant to share that I started in that role without any contacts in the field. Today, there isn't a Fortune 100 company that doesn't know about the product I sold last. Why this answer worked well:She was specific and shared real numbers.She stayed relevant. The experience and the story all came together and she supported it all with numbers.

## Sample answer 2:
My greatest strength is strategic thinking. I am often able to quickly spot patterns and issues and create alternatives before my teammates even realize there is an issue. The way this shows up in my work experience is through risk mitigation. As an example, I was starting a new project with a new team in an industry I had never worked in before. The team seemed to think that the project was very straight-forward and that they didn’t even really need a project manager to help them. We kicked off the project by creating a charter, social contract, and reviewing the risks. We got halfway through the project and realized the requirements were ambiguous and we weren’t delivering what the client really wanted. I had picked up on some subtle cues that this was the case and had already taken the initiative to meet with the client to clarify the requirements. I presented my findings to the team and showed three alternatives to our existing plan to accommodate the updated requirements. From my team’s point of view, I was able to bring solutions to the problem conversation and we didn’t lose any time with the project timeline. It was a win win! Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to detect issues and opportunities early.The example showed a willingness to take initiative to improve clarity and process.

When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.
 
Describe a relevant experience.

If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.
 
Give specific details.

Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.
 
Show them you’re a well-rounded person.

For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.

Tips
Be authentic - don’t make up strengths that you think the employer wants to hear.
Tell a story about a work experience.
Be sure the strengths you share are aligned to the role you want.




# Why do you want to work for our company?

## Overview
- Interviewers ask this question because they want to understand why you are interested in this role at their company and how your goals can solve their needs. When these things align, it’s usually a good match for both parties.

### Answer 1
I have been building cloud-based SaaS products for a long time and I have a lot of experience, having learned important lessons as the field has matured. It is exciting to see a company such as yours, with its rich pedigree in the enterprise on-prem space, venture into the cloud SaaS area. I have led products that have gone on to serve multiple purposes. For example, when I worked for a company that focused on athletics, I led the design and implementation of a product that helped folks track their runs. It created a heatmap so people could track where they ran. Placing their runs in context of a physical terrain made our product different, as did the emphasis on fitness where we tracked how many calories they burned. I added features where people could invite their friends for runs, which created community. As you can see, I have a proven record in being inventive in design and iterative in innovation. My experience, coupled with your market presence, makes for a winning combination. I can add value right away helping your platform scale. And, your products are exciting for me to try out my ideas to scale for a cross-section of customers.

# What is your greatest weakness?

The interviewer is assessing whether your weaknesses will get in the way of doing the job. Employers are looking for humility and whether you’re committed to learning and growing. This is a place you can showcase what you’re doing to improve.

### Answer 1
I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines. I've been reflecting on why this happens. As I've become more conscious of this pattern, I'm working on ways to contain the negative aspects of my eagerness. One way that I do this is to still go to brainstorming meetings but to be more careful about offering to do the next steps—or limit it to one project that my boss supports. Fortunately, though, the job we're discussing seems well-suited for people like me, people that bring a lot of enthusiasm to the job and are ready to keep getting better and better at the follow-through. Why this answer worked well:He shared a story about how a weakness would negatively impact his work and stress him out.He turned his self-awareness into a plan to help him manage that weakness so he would be successful in the future.He shared specific details, which made the story feel relatable.

Sample answer 2
By Marketing & Brand Manager Professional
In my current role as a product manager, I’m responsible for specific feature building. So, I work with a lot of cross-functional teams like engineers and designers. I think one thing that I can always improve on is patience, taking time to really see and understand other people’s perspectives — especially considering we are always rushing to meet tight deadlines. I always want things to move quickly and precisely, which I’ve realized can make my partners a bit anxious. To help with this, I’m working to help build trust. I’ve been scheduling more frequent check-ins with the teams to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the project timeline. And I’ve made myself more open so that they can share any missed opportunities that they see as we go. This gives us a chance to get out ahead of things and make sure we’re all totally aligned even as we work fast. Why this answer worked well:The answer was honest and demonstrated an understanding of how this weakness can affect team members.A clear improvement strategy was outlined.

Sample answer 3
By Mechanical Engineer Professional
I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible. A few years ago, I was working on a remote control, and the schedule was very tight. We were trying to go from concept to mass production in six months, and there was a high amount of pressure. I made the decision to continue with the factory build, even though my team was concerned that one of the parts we were using would fail. Because we had already spent $200,000 on the factory process, I pushed ahead. I was afraid to tell the program managers that we wouldn’t be able to hit our targets. Eventually, I was forced to — but I had already lost the company money. What I learned from this is the importance of being honest right up front and being realistic, even if it’s not the outcome I want. I’ve learned that failures can be turned around more easily when addressed quickly. Now I communicate status with program managers on a weekly basis. I always make them aware of the risks and what the impact might be. In the past four years, we haven't missed a single delivery. Why this answer worked well:The answer provided an honest self-review with a clear example that took the interviewer through the decision-making process.The candidate took accountability and specific steps to prevent another issue.

Sample answer 4
By Marketing & Brand Manager Professional
I have worked on my inclination to hold back on giving tough feedback. A few roles ago, I’d just been promoted to management and joined a project that my boss was leading. The work was about 30% baked when I joined, and I knew right away that it wasn’t strong. I spoke up, but not strongly enough. The agency was pushing their work hard, and I decided not to rock the boat. Unfortunately, as the project progressed, I noticed more and more issues. And as I feared, the campaign bombed. Even though I hadn’t kicked off the project, I was a part of the team, and I owned a big piece of the failure for not sticking to my guns. I learned on that day that even if people don’t agree with you — even if the boss doesn’t agree with you — you owe it to the team and company to vocalize concerns. I’ve taken that lesson a step further by creating the kind of space on my teams for people to dissent, to push back, and to disagree. I firmly believe that successful teams are built on a foundation of respectful, honest communication. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed a willingness to accept responsibility for failure.A clear pivot showed how this weakness was turned into an improvement for teams.



Why should we hire you?

This question tests how persuasive you are. Interviewers want to see if you can make a calm, confident case for yourself, even if they’re acting skeptical. They’re looking for factual and compelling answers.

Having worked in strategy and sales roles across different geographies, I believe I am uniquely positioned to add a lot of value to this general managerial position. What separates me from most is my ability to take a holistic view of the business, set the vision, and translate that into a set of strong strategic solutions. Given my experience across different functions, I also have the ability to connect and influence cross-functional partners to drive business results, which I believe will be critical in this position.

As a data scientist, I’ve demonstrated my ability to answer business questions, as well as advise strategic marketing decisions by providing in-depth data analysis with various technical skills, such as SQL and R. Part of my role has been to evaluate a $30M marketing budget and make recommendations. A recent marketing strategy that I proposed eventually drove growth of 10% for the business. I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation.

My resume demonstrates that I’ve been successful with the key responsibilities of this role: managing teams, developing strategic sales plans, and delivering quarterly targets. I’ve been managing teams for the last 10 years and to this day, many of my former direct reports still call and ask for career or personal advice. I’ve also led the development of strategic plans with the customer for years. I first listen and understand their priorities and objectives, then develop a win-win solution for both parties. Last year my team received 2 awards. The first was from our internal organization for collaboration and partnership in developing our 3-year plans. The second was the Vendor of The Year Award from the customer for putting together plans that exceeded their growth targets. I’ve been in sales for the last 15 years and I know how important it is to hit targets — it’s the lifeblood of what we do. That’s why I work hard to support and guide my team, as well as work with internal partners to anticipate and remove roadblocks. I believe I would be a great fit for this role as I already have relevant experience and been successful in my previous roles. Why this answer worked well:The answer detailed deep industry knowledge and a record of success across several themes.The focus on teams painted a picture of an invested leader who sees success as collective.




Why do you want to work here?

Overview
Interviewers want to understand what prompted you to apply for this job. They don’t want candidates who are indifferent to where they work. Instead, they want someone who offers very specific reasons for why they want this job.


The first thing that prompted me to apply is your commitment to service. I've been a customer for five years since I first bought a house. We had a big storm that damaged my roof last year, and I was impressed by how caring and prompt your customer service representatives were as I worked through it. I'm also excited about your upcoming merger. I can see how this is going to set you apart in the insurance industry. I'd love to help you through the process of integrating the two companies. Having supported a merger three years ago, I know what an intricate and stressful process that can be. I have a few specific ideas on how I might ease the transition.

I grew up in a household that only used your products. Even when we faced tremendous financial difficulty, my mother would always buy razors manufactured by your company – that’s when you realize the role you play in the lives of your consumer is much more than cleaning. You make life a little bit easier, allowing people the time, space and energy to live life at its fullest. When my father immigrated to the U.S from India, I was 6 years old. I don’t remember much – all I remember is that my dad packed 2 suitcases, a box of his mother’s favorite sweets and your company’s personal care products. That’s how important the product is to him and it’s the only razor he has ever used and it’s the only razor I have ever used. I want to work for a brand like that – and I want to bring my father to this office and see the factory where his product is made, first-hand. Why this answer worked well:The answer showed that the candidate is deeply invested in the brand, creating an emotional connection to the company's vision.The personal story showed a real connection to the brand, and genuine enthusiasm for the job.

I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting fast growth company with such a potential with my skills well-suited to add value to the company’s growth. Within the last three years, for example, I set the goal of growing and evolving my team. I was able to coach and promote three different partnership employees into new roles. I was also able to optimize pricing and promotions, which saved the company money and resources and exceeded revenue projections three years in a row. My track record of outperforming expectations and ability lead will help accelerate the fascinating growth you are seeing.

Why this answer worked well:The answer detailed experience in helping growing organizations scale.It was clear that the candidate had personal interest in the company.


# Tell me about a time you showed leadership.

Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative. I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too. In the end, we were able to complete the project by the deadline. The client was pleased and stayed on as a loyal customer to the company. When my boss came back, he gave me an end-of-quarter bonus because he was impressed I was able to rally everyone to complete the project. Why this answer worked well:She shared details that make it easy to visualize what was happening.She described how she got her coworkers onboard and met the deadline to keep her loyal client.

I was working on a high visibility project and during production, two members on my cross-functional team had different approaches to a problem that we were facing. They both wanted credit for being right, and we were at a stalemate. To move forward, I needed to help align the team. I wasn’t their reporting manager but I was the project lead, so I asked them to explain the pros and cons of their approach. I encouraged them to fairly assess their solutions and moderated the discussion so that it stayed productive and respectful. As they laid out their plans, it became clear that a hybrid approach would be best for the company. I encouraged them to see this as a team win towards a common goal that would reflect positively on everyone. Using the hybrid approach, we not only delivered a superior solution, but completed the project 2 weeks ahead of schedule because the team was so motivated. Why this answer worked well:The answer highlighted both communication and moderation skills.Beyond the success of achieving consensus, the candidate improved the project timeline.

During a recent project, I was responsible for helping to improve the margins of an existing product line used by multiple customer segments. The product had multiple elements of design, manufacturing, and software support. Leadership had been eyeing cost-cutting efforts for some time. My first step was to clearly understand the situation and how the product had become less profitable. So, I sat down with the design, sales, marketing, and operations teams to document all perspectives. In parallel, I met with the finance team to clearly understand areas of potential savings. In the end, I identified 3 clear steps: streamline processes around assembly and testing, make small design tweaks to remove unnecessary features, and simplify the product overall. Making this proposal required talking to each team individually, armed with financial data that could convince them that this effort was worthwhile. The data had to make sense and projections needed to be realistic. I also needed to leverage my technical background to understand nuances in the design and assembly. Ultimately, the effort saved the company more than $5M over the next two years, and helped set the precedent for efficient and lean product development. Why this answer worked well:The answer set the stage and detailed each action step.The candidate’s approach showed a holistic view of the challenge and deep understanding of the business.Leadership skills were proven by significant, quantifiable results.

A few years ago, I took over the Web Operations team of a major company. This was a new area for me and when I stepped into the role, I immediately identified a clear need to completely rebuild 35 worldwide websites across eight different languages. I created a plan for the rebuild which included hiring additional technical writers, securing media agencies, acquiring new software, and more. This plan was meant to be enacted over 18 months but after I presented my plan to executive management, the CEO requested that we complete the project before the end of the year. This gave us just 12 months, which meant we had to rethink our project plan. The readjustment required the addition of even more resources and distributing the translation work to different teams — all while managing risk carefully. I am happy to say that after 12 months, the project was completed successfully, and team morale remained high throughout the process. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated their ability to identify opportunity areas.The solution required a blend of soft and technical skills and the ability to lead cross-functional teams.The example also highlighted the ability to adjust a plan to meet aggressive deadlines.


# Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.


If you can show that you’ve helped a team move through a challenge, you probably have strong communication and interpersonal skills. These kinds of “soft” skills are in high demand and make people successful in their job

I was asked to work on a high-profile project that included collaborating with a new team and tons of people across a larger organization. We were spread out across the globe, which meant timezones were tricky and we could never meet face-to-face. Communication was starting to get confusing, and people were losing important details. It became apparent that this project was going to fail if we didn’t have a new strategy, so I met with various team members and engaged them in a process where we designed and implemented a communication system that would work a lot better. We then did weekly check-ins; designed a protocol to share relevant updates so we’d stay on track; developed a detailed outline of goals and milestones; and led the meetings. In the end, the team made massive progress. We completed the project on time, and it was praised extensively by the client. The team thanked me for helping to course-correct. We also continue to use these tools, and they are what make our team so much more efficient at what we do. Why this answer worked well:She started off discussing a specific situation and the issues involved with having to work on a global team.She talked about the specific action steps she took like implementing a new work process.She described the positive results and teamwork skills she demonstrated along the way.


While working for a major airline, I was on a team that was tasked to jointly determine the growth plans for a joint venture we operated in partnership with two other airlines. Naturally, the team was made up of individuals based around the world, each with very different views on the economic and competitive landscape. At first, our plans clashed significantly. One challenge we were trying to solve in our term sheet was how to adjust our plans during times of economic uncertainty. Each team had a different idea for what actions to take, and when. To help reach alignment I proposed that we look at real historic examples of economic downturns, bankruptcies, volcanic eruptions, and similar events — and use them as case examples to set a range of appropriate reactions. Then, we’d tie these reactions to indicators, such as global passenger volume, GDP growth, and stock market indicators — all universally understood and applicable. Once we established this framework for using hard data to guide acceptable strategic actions, the team was able to collaborate with more trust and a common language. Our analysis was unified and based on the same inputs, and this allowed us to quickly and successfully align on a term sheet for the joint venture. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showcased their ability to align stakeholders with very divergent points of view.The answer included strategic thinking skills and personal initiative.


I joined a team 6 months after the MVP launch which was moderately successful, but short of management expectations. Without a real roadmap, the team was just running small experiments to drive incremental gains. I quickly realized that we’d need to do more than that to realize the long-term vision of the product. To gain the trust of my new team, I focused on what could be improved in the immediate future. I helped rationalize the short-term experiment roadmap, organized execution, removed roadblocks, and helped ship few of the high potential experiments. Concurrently, I spent time with the executive team to understand their expectations. After observing users and analyzing our logs, I partnered with team leads across Engineering, Design, and Research to develop an updated mission statement and a set of defined success metrics. Within 3 months, we were charging full-speed ahead with an updated roadmap, improvement operational metrics, and significant boost on a platform satisfaction survey. Two years later, the product had been used by hundreds of millions of people every month — 40 times the amount we started with. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated their ability to identify areas of opportunity, backed up by quantifiable results.The answer included important soft skills like collaboration and team-building.


As part of the developing a product roadmap for a CRM product line, I’m proud to have uncovered an unmet need during a user empathy session. One of the pain points that kept coming up was around the end customers spending too much time and effort in creating nested workflows for their activity-based marketing campaigns. I Identified a way to do a rapid prototype of a ‘workflow’ module using natural language that can be invoked based on voice commands and keywords to create complex workflows. I demonstrated the idea and prototype to leadership to obtain support, then met with one of the key engineering leads to develop a timetable to develop this concept without risking the other features on the roadmap. In 2016, we filed a new patent in natural language processing. This capability can be a ‘plug-in’ module to several first party and third party software products that are focused on business process automation and workflows — which has generated a steady stream of licensing revenue to date. Why this answer worked well:The candidate highlighted their ability to discover opportunities and innovate new solutions.The success of the patent was a win for both customers and the company.



# What would your co-workers say about you?


Interviewers want to know if you’ll fit in with the team. This question can also help you highlight your strengths without feeling like you’re bragging.


I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects. In one of my LinkedIn recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the “Human Glue”, which is something I'm proud of. She gave me that nickname after we went through a complex ERP implementation. It was one of those stressful time-critical projects that required the team to come together and make things happen in a short amount of time. I kept the crew going, sometimes through long evening and weekend hours, and inspired them to bring their absolute best to the project everyday. I think that they also appreciated the pizza and donuts I brought in too. Why this answer worked well:He shared something specifically related to the job.He pointed the interviewer to a supervisor's favorable LinkedIn recommendation.He shared a bit of humor.


I would expect that most coworkers would describe me as driven. When I join teams or start on projects, I spend a lot of time understanding what’s most important about the work, which is a huge motivating factor for me. Once I lock in on what matters most, I share it with the team so we’re all invested with a common purpose. Being driven allows me to share what some have called my “infectious enthusiasm” with others and rally the team, and also means that I spend a lot of time with my work to make sure it’s done well. My teams have solid track records of hitting if not exceeding their goals because of this focus and ability to motivate. A good example was when I was working with quite a large group, and our project was given to us top-down. This didn’t feel empowering for the team, but I worked with leadership and our user research team to help the engineers and designers recognize the value of what we were working on. It was slated to be a multiyear project, but because the team was motivated and we focused on creating specifications for the product, we were able to deliver a prototype in just a few months. Why this answer worked well:The answer painted a picture of a strong, motivating team member.The candidate detailed how their strength directly benefited their employer.



My coworkers have told me that I am a technical leader who sets ambitious goals, reliably delivers work on time, and shows empathy to each team member. In a recent peer review, I received great feedback for being a team player. One of my coworkers needed to take some time off to address some pressing personal issues. He wasn’t comfortable asking, as we were working on a very tight timeline and everyone had limited bandwidth — especially me. But knowing that he would be stronger in his role and that the team would be healthier if he was given space to handle outside concerns, I offered to take up his responsibilities for 3 weeks. It was a stretch, but I knew it was temporary. I emphasized time management and prioritization to ensure that no deadlines were missed. When he returned, he was able to focus and our team was even more productive. Why this answer worked well:The candidate utilized a blend of soft and technical skills, and the success was supported by peer review.The example suggests that the candidate would be a strong team player and good culture fit.

Years ago, I read a book called Seeing Yourself as Others Do. The book posits that while we are young in our careers, we can get away with being aggressive in our work style and stepping on toes to get things done. However, as we progress, we’re inevitably tasked with more responsibilities than we could ever handle alone. At this point, it becomes imperative to have the support of those around us — whether or not they are direct reports. I have taken this message seriously and built relationships with people all over the organization. I regularly meet with people from other departments who I don’t normally work with. Because of this strong foundation, I am comfortable picking up the phone and asking for help from a large network of colleagues. And it isn’t just one way! I regularly get calls requesting help and advice on a wide array of projects. As such, I would expect that my coworkers would say that I’m personable, supportive, hard-working, and thoughtful. We spend more time with our co-workers than we do our own families, so it’s important to keep professional relationships strong for team morale and success. Why this answer worked well:The answer highlighted an interest in career growth and meaningful investment of time.Relationship-based examples indicate strong collaborative skills.


# Why do you want to leave your current role?
Overview
Employers say they want to hire people who are running “to” a role as opposed to running “away.” However, they are also interested in your honesty when things haven’t worked out and will give people second chances when they demonstrate hunger.

I'm eager to find a new opportunity and grow. As you can see, I've been doing the same kind of work for two and a half years, and I'm starting to stagnate. My company doesn't have a role open for the next step up, unfortunately. So, I'm excited about the opportunity of becoming a sales manager at your company. The new role will let me use the skills I've developed in my current role like making cold calls; hooking in new clients with pithy-but-inspiring opening lines; following up with carefully crafted emails; listening to their pain points; and then offering up solutions that can solve their problems. I'm eager to make a fresh start, and I want to use my cold calling and listening skills to help craft an even better solution with the product I'd be working on in this new role. Why this answer worked well:She was positive and talked about her excitement about the new role. She did say she started to stagnate in her current role though, so she should tweak that language a bit to make it more favorable to them.She talked about using her current skills to gain new skills and experiences as a sales manager.She framed this in the context of the new role and the new job she's applying for. She should make it even more about how excited she is about the products—and selling them—for the company she's applying to.

I believe that the key to long-term professional growth is gathering critical, foundational experiences. In my case, my aspiration is to lead a large multinational business in a general managerial capacity. To get there, I have identified a set of enabling experiences, and have been very intentional in choosing my roles and assignments so far. While I have learned an immense amount in my current role as a strategic insights marketing manager, I believe that it’s the right time to expand my learning with a new challenge. Over the last 4 years, I have worked across a variety of marketing, strategy, and sales assignments across different global regions. I’ve built a strong understanding of how to sustainably grow brands & businesses through consumer-centric strategies. In the next stage of my career, I’d like to lead a mid-sized business team by setting the long-term vision and translating that into short-term tactics. It’s also important to me to create an environment where my team can deliver great work while feeling empowered and energized. Why this answer worked well:The candidate was able to distill key learnings from their current employment and identify additional growth areas.The answer outlined clear career goals and a progress plan.


I’ve enjoyed my time with my current employer, and have grown a lot in my role. In the past 2 years, I’ve successfully shipped several products that turned out to be very successful. I believe that the next big trend for product development will be centered heavily around mobile shopping. My current company is looking at a possible move in this direction within a number of years, rather than months. I’m interested in joining your team because the products you’re developing are in the exact area I’d like to explore and grow. This role would give me an opportunity to build a solid understanding of complex problems and how to navigate through ambiguity, preparing me to adapt to new challenges quickly. I would also hone my data analytics skills, as I am already familiar with analyzing trends and insights in different customer segments and cohorts. And finally, I would strengthen my communication and leadership skills. As a product leader, it is super important to understand the resources, challenges, and priorities across the organization, and to drive synergy across teams. I love that your team is lean and fast-moving, and I believe that my product management skills, drive, and enthusiasm would make me a great fit for the organization. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed an ability to recognize industry trends and opportunities.The answer outlined a strong career vision.Skills were tied directly to the job description.



I enjoy my current role and am not actually actively pursuing a change. I am, however, very open to intellectually stimulating and challenging opportunities that will allow me to provide value. I’m interested in a role where I am responsible to deliver and actively contribute towards company success. I am also seeking continued development and improvement, both personally and professionally. Based on the job description and our discussions, this role does seem like a good match. I’ve long admired this company and am passionate about both the mission and the products. I believe that my record of success, unique experience, and background would make me an asset to the team. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed interest in further development and connected that ambition to the role.The answer included an openness to new challenges and passion for the company.



# Describe your most challenging project

Employers want to get a sense of what ‘challenging’ means to you. They also want to know how you handled the situation in a calm way. They’re looking for a storyline to prove that you can turn a bad story into a good story.

In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide. The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page. Partway through, I discovered that some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. The implications were significant, and a delay to the campaign would negatively impact our revenue goals. I identified the root causes of the delays and set up a plan of action to address them. I planned in-depth one-on-one meetings with the team leaders to help re-inspire them. We talked about the goals and set ambitious targets for getting these last items across the finish line. I then organized and led status-update calls for the larger team and implemented a public dashboard to keep everyone accountable. In the end, we did meet the marketing campaign deadlines and the product launch was a hit. The company hit their revenue goals and everyone on the sales team received a well-deserved bonus. Why this answer worked well:She told us about the potential for serious negative consequences.She described concrete action steps she took to overcome this challenge.She shared the positive results of her actions.

I was brought into a project right before the ramp, when the existing team ran into a blocker issue. They were severely constrained in both resources and time, and didn’t have the bandwidth to address it. Obviously, there was a lot at stake. The expectation was that I would quickly solve the issue, but I was coming in completely cold and the team was stressed and resistant to stop what they were doing to bring me up to speed. Success required two things. First, I needed to clearly explain exactly what I needed from each team member — and why. Second, I needed to gather this information and context as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once the team realized that there was a process in place, they were very responsive. With all the appropriate inputs, I was able to create a plan to solve the issue within just one week. The team just needed a point person to align everyone. Once I did that, we were able to get things back on track and deliver the project on time. Why this answer worked well:The candidate was able to clearly articulate the challenges, requirements for success, and the use of soft and technical skills to solve a problem.The answer indicated a willingness to be adaptable, and the ability to meet aggressive deadlines.

While working for a major airline, I needed to adjust a financial model that shared revenue between all the airlines in our partnership. The model used a common industry metric, RASM, to calculate unit revenue — based on the number of seats in an aircraft. But without a universal standard for airplane design, this metric favored some partners over others. To fix this issue, I had to establish a standard without unwanted bias. The new system also needed to be set by an unbiased party. I reached out to contacts I had at our OEMs asking for support. Only a few firms build the majority of all aircraft, and each offered to have their engineering teams create a standard for my purposes. The challenge came from several obstacles: the incredible depth of detail down to every last square foot of each aircraft in our fleet, close communication with partners and suppliers, clear direction for both business leaders and technical engineers, and the need to rally all partners to a cause that would benefit the collective. Overall, clear communication and persistent attention to detail powered the successful completion of this project. Why this answer worked well:The level of detail demonstrated deep subject matter expertise.The candidate showed the ability to break down problems into smaller manageable pieces, creating a clear path forward that takes pros and cons into consideration.

I was tasked with implementing a uniform data platform for a large, multinational company with tens of thousands of employees. It had to be done in such a way that it could be used by teams spread out all over the world. There were several challenges associated with implementing a platform of this size and importance. We had to make sure the platform would be well-adopted, add value, and be approved by the executive team. Besides the technical complexities of building such a platform, this project was also challenging because we had to influence global teams. To accomplish this, I created a high-level strategy. Then, I asked Senior VPs to nominate reports to form one global team that could represent the entire organization. Ultimately, we succeeded in building a platform that was adopted globally, thanks to a strategic plan executed by a collaborative task force that incorporated both global needs and local aspirations. Why this answer worked well:Leading a project of global scale demonstrates the ability to provide high-level strategy while being capable of localizing the executions.The candidate detailed the complications of the project and the action steps taken.


# Tell me about something you’ve accomplished that you are proud of.


This question assesses how you define a professional success. If the story resonates, the employer will want you to do similar things at his or her company. You should focus on the impact and outcomes.

When I first joined the company, I noticed that the existing monthly budgeting process was quite time-consuming and inefficient because it was highly manual. There were errors and inaccuracies, and I took the initiative to implement a new budgeting template to automate the process and make it simpler. I developed automated calculations using Excel and fill-in-the-blank lines for departments to submit their numbers. Then I designed and led a training for all relevant staff. The new system made it easier for the departments to provide their budgets in an error-free way. Overall, we had 25% fewer errors in the next cycle of budgets and my team became 30% more efficient. My manager gave me a very strong review for the quarter and noted that she appreciated my initiative to automate and make the process a lot less cumbersome. Why this answer worked well:She started off by discussing the situation she inherited when she joined the company.She described the action steps she took to improve the situation.She quantified the positive results and relayed how impactful this was for her and her team.


In my role on the innovation strategy team, I helped create a long-term innovation pipeline which led to multiple product launches for a critical business unit. While the company was a market leader in the space, we had been rapidly losing market share over the last few years. My first action was to identify the root cause of our declines. Through a detailed analysis, I identified that our product lineup didn’t fully satisfy evolving consumer needs. I also examined our past product launches and found that they’d lacked differentiated utility. I got approval from leadership to take an end-to-end approach using design thinking. We started with consumer immersions to understand how our products are used and which barriers we’d need to overcome. From there, we created new product concepts. We tested the concepts with consumers and created a long-term innovation pipeline. Finally, we partnered with cross-functional teams to charter and launch 3 products in just 2 years. This increased market share for the first time in 5 years, and we have seen sustained sales growth ever since. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to think critically, develop a strategy, and execute a plan.The answer showed how those efforts led to a positive business result.



Only a few months into my role, I was asked to lead another product area because the team hadn’t been successful after several attempts. I realized that the org itself posed a challenge. We were essentially operating as 3 separate teams on 3 different sites, in 3 different time zones. So, my first step was to visit each site to build trust and learn more about their priorities, since we would need buy-in from each team. Next, I collaborated with the horizontal metrics team to determine a metric that would capture the value of the project, as well as each individual team’s success. We assembled a team that consisted of engineers from each site and kicked off the project together. We set up a regular travel schedule to support this new team dynamic. When we hit technical issues, we were able to iterate quickly. I’m really proud of the final product for a number of reasons: It was a hot potato that had failed multiple times. And the result is awesome. Not only by our numbers, but I personally know tons of people who really love using it. Finally, I was able to build meaningful relationships with multiple senior stakeholders. Why this answer worked well:The candidate’s involvement was directly connected to the success of the project.The answer clearly outlined the problem solving steps, and showed dedication, and subject matter expertise.


In the last year, I led the launch of an entirely new e-commerce business channel within my company. Data showed us that users have a tendency to impulse buy on social media — and I saw an opportunity to embed a shopping feature in our social media app. With just a lean team of two analysts, I led a 6 month research project in which we interviewed 100 people on how they use social media, exploring their interest and intent when they saw a product image. I also had in-depth conversations with leaders of engineering, user research, and data scientists to understand what would be required to build this feature. Finally, we developed a cost analysis that detailed the resources and manpower we’d need to create a new division. The preparation and research provided a strong enough case to be approved at the highest levels of leadership. The company implemented this new business channel and revenue stream, and I’m really proud to have played a key role in a huge growth moment. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated abilities to distill insights, identify key opportunity areas, and create actionable recommendations that led to new revenue streams.The answer included the detailed steps taken to execute a strategy.


# Can you explain your employment gap?

This question isn’t designed to rule you out - it’s a good sign if you get the interview. Interviewers want to get more context about the gap and whether you’re still going to be a great fit for the role, despite the gap.


Yes, so a few years ago I was working in Seattle as a global finance manager. I loved my job and got to travel all over the world. My dad, who lives in Michigan, was diagnosed with dementia that same year, and my mom was having a hard time giving him the level of care he needed. I decided to put my career on pause and go help them. I not only got to spend quality time with my parents and sister, but I was able to get their finances in order so that when it was time for him to enter a care home, they were in a great spot to afford it. He's doing really well at the facility, so now I can refocus on my career. Why this answer worked well:He told the truth; he left work to care for a family member.He delivered it with confidence and was unapologetic about the gap.He showcased the positive by explaining his action plan to keep his finance skills sharp.

Looking at my resume, you’ll notice I have an employment gap of 5 months. I was relocating internationally and had to go through the administrative process of procuring my travel visa and work authorization permits. During this time, I couldn’t legally be employed abroad. The time off was a blessing. It allowed me to recharge my batteries and use the time to stay current with industry and consumer trends. I took the opportunity to evaluate my career journey and make sure I was working towards my long-term goal of being a multinational general manager. Without the day-to-day hustle, I was able to be introspective and distill the lessons I’d taken away in previous roles, and start planning my intentions for the next. I also used the time to read up on the latest developments in design thinking and innovation, and even took a couple online courses in these spaces. What initially seemed like a frustrating forced break ended up being a very positive period of time for me, and I was able to start my next chapter feeling inspired and refreshed. Why this answer worked well:The answer painted a picture of an ambitious self-starter.The candidate showed interest to learn and grow beyond his current role, which is valuable for cross-team collaboration in the future.


The 2-month gap on my resume was intentional. I wanted to leave space to prepare for a big international move and take the opportunity to travel. I’d been heads-down for much of my career, and this seemed like an ideal time to unplug. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, I didn’t end up moving or traveling, and the new job fell through. I’ve used the time to brush up on my Spanish through online tutoring, practice some new recipes, and make my way through a reading list that’s relevant for my next role. I have also spent time thinking deeply about the contributions I’d like to make in the next chapter of my career and develop some concrete goals. Finally, I’ve been volunteering remotely with a London-based organization that I’m really excited about. The unexpected time off has given me a chance to reevaluate some priorities and goals, find inspiration, and recharge for my next move. Why this answer worked well:The candidate showed the ability to be productive during an unstructured time.The answer detailed skills and learnings that may be beneficial to an employer.



After experiencing a layoff, I created a list of things I wanted to accomplish with the time. I had always wished for more time for creative pursuits like fiction writing, so I spent time developing a TV pilot and framework for a 10 episode arc. Letting my creative juices flow was very rewarding. I found the routine to be therapeutic, and the experience of creation to be invigorating. I also researched companies I was interested in and kept a running list of job requirements that mirrored my own qualifications. I created a document that I could forward to a hiring manager that complimented my resume, highlighting specific skills and real-life experience. This exercise prompted me to evaluate my goals and skills, and to hone in on my next move. The time was well spent. I harnessed my creative side, found inspiration, and created a tailored plan that truly captured my career ambitions. Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated a self-starter mindset by creating structure.The time was used to reflect and accomplish goals.
