# What is React ?
 React is an efficient, flexible, and open-source JavaScript framework library that allows developers to the creation of simple, fast, and scalable web applications.
    
# The important features of React are:

- It supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).
- Component-Based Architecture : React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and modular development.
- Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)
- It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow. 
- In a unidirectional data flow architecture, data flows in a single direction, typically from a parent component down to its child components.
- Parent Component Manages Data
- Data Passed to Child Components
- Child Components Cannot Directly Modify Data
- It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.
- JSX (JavaScript XML): JSX is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes it easier to describe the structure of UI components and is transpiled to regular JavaScript.
- React Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that allow developers to add state and other React features to functional components. This eliminates the need for class components and provides a more consistent way to manage component state and lifecycle methods.
- Reconciliation: React efficiently updates the DOM by comparing changes in the virtual DOM (after a component's state or props change) with the previous version. This process, known as reconciliation, minimizes the number of actual DOM manipulations required.
- React Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that allow developers to add state and other React features to functional components. This eliminates the need for class components and provides a more consistent way to manage component state and lifecycle methods.
- Context API: React's Context API allows for state to be shared across multiple components without the need for prop drilling (passing data through multiple levels of components). It's useful for managing global or shared state.

# List of Available Hooks in React
- useState Hook
- useEffect Hook
- useContext & createContext Hook
- useReducer Hook
- useCallback Hook

- Explain the concept of higher-order components (HOCs)
    Higher-order components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. They are used to share common functionality between components.
