# React Concepts and Hooks

- Component
- Props
- State
- Fragment (`<> </>`, we can't pass the key, `<React.Fragment key=1> </React.Fragment>`)
- Pure Component / Memo (Memo is for functional components, while pure component only for class components. We'll skip pure component since we're focusing on functional components)
- Refs
- HOC (Higher Order Component)

- [Hooks](https://youtu.be/cF2lQ_gZeA8)
  - Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8
  - Avoid the confusion with the 'this' keyword
  - Hooks don't contain any breaking changes, ensuring 100% backward compatibility
  - Reuse stateful logic
  - Organize logic into reusable isolated units
  - Hooks can't be used inside class components, but they allow using React features without classes
  - Hooks don't replace existing knowledge of React concepts
  - Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to familiar React concepts
- Rules of Hooks
  - "Only Call Hooks at the Top Level"
  - Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
  - "Only Call Hooks from React Functions"
  - Call them from within React functional components, not regular JavaScript functions
- useState Hook
  - The useState hook adds state to functional components
  - In classes, state is always an object
  - useState returns an array with 2 elements: the current state value and a state setter function
  - New state value depends on the previous state value? You can pass a function to the setter
  - When dealing with objects or arrays, spread (...) state variable and call the setter function
- useEffect Hook
  - The Effect Hook performs side effects in functional components
  - It's a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount

- useContext & createContext Hook
  - Context passes data through the component tree without manual prop passing at every level
- useReducer Hook
  - useReducer is used for state management in React
  - It's related to reducer functions in JavaScript
  - useReducer(reducer, initialState)
  - reducer(currentState, action)

- useRef Hook
- Custom Hooks
  - A custom Hook is a JavaScript function starting with "use"
  - Custom hooks can call other Hooks if required
